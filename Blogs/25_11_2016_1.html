	Hello.
	<br>
	<br>
	So, I have a new project I'd quite like to see finished, so I'm going to be pushing myself into setting and following deadlines, as well as just generally putting more effort into planning and accountability. I'm going to be having my friend Ben review my code when he gets the time to help me improve my coding practices and maybe the game itself.
	<br>
	<br>
	This week I'm going to be working on getting ready for an initial prototype. The basics have been laid out in my notebook and on my computer, but I'd like to further expand on it before I start my initial prototype.
	<br>
	<br>
	This week, I'm going to
	<br>
	<br>
	<i>//At this point, I bought 5 games on Humble Bundle, 2 games on Steam, a mug on DFTBA, and started watching Youtube videos. In my culture, this is a sign that this project will go flawlessly and will suffer no issues whatsoever.</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	complete rudimentary, non-exhaustive documentation of most basic gameplay concepts and features, and from that list I will write a guideline for the things needed for an initial prototype.
	<br>
	<br>
	At the end of each week, on Friday, I will write an honest post-mortem of that week's work, laying out what I did right and what I did wrong, as well as my plans for the next week.
	<br>
	<br>
	At the moment I'm working the equivalent of a full-time job, so right off the bat I expect these goals will be about 20% done by the end of the week
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Goals for the first week:</b>
	<br>
	Basic design document
	<br>
	List of necessary features for initial prototype
	<br>
	<br>
	Now, in order to get this project off on the right foot, I'm going to save this and go play video games.
	<br>
	<br>
