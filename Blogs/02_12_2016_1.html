	<h2>(Captain) Week 1</h2>

	Hello.
	<br>
	<br>
	So, the first week is over. I did about as well as I expected, getting a lot less done than I'd planned.
	<br>
	<br>
	According to Steam I played almost 22 hours of games this week. I think we've identified a bit of a problem of mine.
	<br>
	<br>
	Despite this... frankly worrying amount of playtime, I did get 3 pages of the design document done, as well as 2 pages of the prototype outline. This honestly isn't a lot. The design document was essentially just copying over existing notes in a more readable format, and the outline only has a few basic elements fully described and ready to go.
	<br>
	<br>
	While I did do a full 40 hours of other work, that's not a very good excuse for using 22 of my remaining 128 hours to game. If you take out my sleep, I still have 50 hours of time remaining. I have no idea what I was doing during those hours, but aside from probably 8 total hours spent on what I did get done, what's important is that the rest of that time was spent doing nothing productive (Trust me)
	<br>
	<br>
	While I'm trying to make my design document fairly comprehensive, my prototype outline is mostly based on what barebones features I would require to get something playable yet also mostly representetive of my current vision. More complex features will be left until later on in development.
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm going to get more specific with my goals this week, now that I know what I'm up for.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Goals for Week 2:</b>
	<br>3 more pages of design document
	<br>4 more pages of prototype outline
	<br>Less than 22 hours spent playing games
	<br>
	<br>
	Alright, I'll be back next week.
	<br>
	<br>

	PS: Ittle Dew is a fantastic game despite some rough edges and possibly some bugs keeping me from 100%ing it. 9/10
	<br>
	<br>
	PPS: Ittle Dew 2 improves on the combat and world map, but the boss design on the main bosses gets old and can be a bit too difficult and overly reliant on your main weapon over the dungeon item. Still enjoying it and want to 100% it, 8/10
