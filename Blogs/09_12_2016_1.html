	<h2>(Captain) Week 2</h2>
	December 9th, 2016 (Friday)<br>

	Hello.
	<br>
	<br>
	Week 2 done! I got simultaneously more and less done than I wanted to.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Week 2 Checklist:</b>
	<br>4/3 design document pages written
	<br>0.25/4 prototype outline pages written
	<br>14 hours spent playing games (8 hours less than last week)
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm pretty proud of the extra page in the design document, but I had a hard time working on my prototype outline. I think I've gotten too technical with it instead of simply writing out a list of basic features as I'd originally planned. This has influenced my goals for week 3:
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Goals for Week 3:</b>
	<br>2 more design document pages
	<br>Simplify prototype outline and add 3 pages
	<br>Lose a pound
	<br>
	<br>
	That last one really has no business being here, but I need extra incentives. At a point, I had lost 47 pounds from my max weight but I've been floating around the 35 pounds lost point for a while, time to get back into it.
	<br>
	<br>

	PS: I bought a $450 shoretrooper helmet from Rogue One :c

	Pics when it arrives!
