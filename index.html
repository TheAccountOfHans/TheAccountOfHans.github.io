	Virtually all of my time is spent making or playing games. I've been "playing" Cookie Clicker for
	<a href="http://i.imgur.com/KvGW0mP.jpg">3 years straight</a> somehow.
	<br><br>
	I started making games in Game Maker around 2003, when I was 9. Over the years I moved from it's drag & drop-styled
	visual programming, to GML, to a brief stint with Blitz BASIC for a Grade 11 course, to Unity and C# in 2013, which I use
	to this day.
	<br><br>
	I am very interested in VR, and own an original Oculus Rift dev kit (Which no longer works for developing). I released a
	small demo allowing the player to walk around the bridge of a Star Destroyer as it enters battle. I've
	also created a number of other, unreleased demos that made me learn the meaning of "Sim sickness." There are a few
	that I'd still like to continue development on if I can ever afford the proper hardware.
	<br><br>
	I've made countless experiments* in my time, and I've even finished a couple of projects here and there, such as a
	TIE Fighter arcade game, released under a psuedonym because it is definitely not a huge copyright infringement
	that could incur the wrath of certain companies. Tell all your friends!
	<br><br>
	Below are some links to videos of my various projects from recent years. You may sense some mad desire to make a Star Wars game.
	I can assure you that you are totally off base and should consider seeing a psychiatrist.

	<b>Projects in order unknown (And what I learned from them)</b>

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSFbFLCjvwg"><b>Star Destroyer Oculus Rift Demo (Stereoscopy, Framerate in VR)</b></a>
	<br>
	By far the most popular thing I ever released, this allowed users to step onto the bridge of a Star Destroyer as it entered a battle.
	I learned a lot about scale, here. It's very hard to convey, but stereoscopy means those ships actually appear to be a mile long.
	What I took to heart from this, though, after having issues with LOD and framerate (But never got to apply to this specific project),
	is that the use of multiple cameras and cascading shadows is completely necessary to keep even a semblance of a steady framerate, and that,
	in VR, without that, you are truly in for some pain.

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ArSrl7n7A"><b>TIE (Flight AI, Refactoring as a lifeskill)</b></a>
	<br>
	By far the least-seen-but-probably-would've-done-well-if-it-had-been thing I ever released, this was an arcade-ish simulator-ish space combat game allowing
	the player to engage unending waves of rebel ships from the cockpit of their TIE Fighter. This was a huge, huge lesson in classes, states, getting angles
	around specific axes, and why you shouldn't build on top of your wild-west prototype code as a finished product. I have an update in the works but honestly,
	the base code is so jumbled and flawed due to my rapid-prototyping-turned-release, it would genuinely be easier to rewrite it with everything I've learned.
	I released it under a psuedonym to avoid a direct connection to me in event of Disney finding out and being displeased. So uh... don't tell them, okay?
	Honestly, the AI for this is pretty basic but can provide quite a challenge to the player later into the game, while remarkebly retaining the feel
	of one of the battles from the movies. Due to excluding yaw, the ships must first roll until their target direction
	is along their vertical axis, then pull up. A lot of tweaking and fudging ensued to get a halfway-decent AI. Unfortunately, they were not very good at
	avoiding collisions and so some workarounds were made to simply fool the player into thinking they avoided collisions instead of them blowing up all the time.
	I've got a new system for that in mind that could theoretically work: By sending out detection whiskers a decent distance, and turning to a direction
	that's basically the incoming angle reflected off the collider's normal, the AI would theoretically be able to handle a lot of collision events,
	excluding complex geometry, while still being able to smoothly track their targets and setting up some pretty cool chases along the surface of a Super Star Destroyer.

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Ai8XE_azs"><b>AT-ST (Animation, Physics)</b></a>
	<br>
	This was a bit of a test in physics and animations using mathematical curves, as well as in creating fancy particles.
	I experimented with having the motion and other physics driven by the animations themselves, and this is the result.
	I learned a lot about Rigidbodies, and why you should hire an animator instead of using math.

	<br>
	
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZSPc_wdNHc"><b>Warden (Animation, Dynamic sound)</b></a>
	<br>
	This immediately followed my AT-ST test after a friend implied I couldn't make original designs and relied on Star Wars as a crutch.
	Well, he's right, but the resulting project was this WWI-era mech, animated without math this time. The main focus of this project became
	the walking sound of the mech, and how to create a unique sound profile that would work in any situation you put it in. Instead of
	creating a unique, "baked" sound effect, what you hear in this video is each joint of each leg scraping and squeaking based on
	its rotational velocity, using a single scraping loop and pitching and changing the audio. I'd like to revisit this idea someday,
	preferably as a moody combat simulator in VR.

	<a href="https://youtu.be/XVdEIE0NdfQ"><b>Tank Game (Drawing to textures, Gameplay before polish)</b></a>
	<br>
	This was me trying to make something suitably 90's to fit my obssession with games in a 90's style (Hence the bitcrushed audio and pixelized 3D),
	and one of my few attempts at a 2-player splitscreen game. The players are tanks on a battlefield, attempting to hunt down the other
	player and exterminate them. The biggest advancement was the use of drawing on textures to make persistent tread tracks and other patterns in the
	sand. While my solution here is fairly low-res, a smaller map, or the use of multiple textures, would've allowed for good performance and a better-looking
	effect overall. I was fully ready to release this game until my friend came over to playtest it with me, and I found out two things:<br><br>
	1: This isn't very fun, and<br><br>
	2: Never let anyone have the ability to paint the terrain because they will realise they can paint offensive things as long as you don't find them for a while.<br><br>
	On point 1, looking back, I think I could actually make this a more tense, fun game by reducing the fire-rate on the weapons and massively increasing their damage.
	As well, the tanks were fairly difficult to control and tended to get more airtime than I wanted. This was something I skirted
	around in a later project, Tank Touge, by adding what might be called "Suspension" but may better be referred to as "Was there's a collision there? Let's ignore
	THAT for a few frames". On point 2, well, it's SLIGHTLY OFFENSIVE, but as long as your friend isn't a massive edgelord it'll probably be more funny than
	anything to crest a hill during your mad search for your opponent and see something like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yhqE3QB.png">this</a> (Profane language warning).

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k6MZcpIHE4"><b>Robit (Animation, Character locomotion)</b></a>
	<br>
	(Sorry about the 80's music)<br>
	This was a test for a character action game in a PS1 aesthetic, which started quickly after Warden, as I'd just learned rudimentary animation.
	I learned a bit about shaders, camera-relative directional input, and messing with physics to produce something that works as a player would
	expect, rather than as physics would demand. Later additions included wall-running, toxic liquids, and rope-swinging after reading a blog
	by the person behind Spider-Man 2's web-swinging physics.

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=521PMcvUYQo"><b>Tank Touge (Cheating physics, GUI)</b></a><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCd2rRibFRU"><b>(Second Video)</b></a>
	<br>
	(Sorry about the 90's music)<br>
	This was based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnTVbsfixfM">video</a> a friend sent me. Over the course of a couple of days
	and with the use of assets from Tank Game, I created a prototype of a game where you drift various eras of tanks against another player,
	scoring more points by executing better drifts and finishing the course faster than them, whilst using your cannon to provide a boost and potentially
	slow down the player behind you. Then I realised I didn't want to spend the time to create an actual track and lost interest. Unlike an earlier
	game prototype about drifting, I ignored wheel colliders and actual vehicle physics because I don't know enough about cars, and focused instead
	on providing nice-feeling fake-physics whilst doing my best to avoid flinging the rigidbody across the world. As you can see in the first video,
	I had some problems with flickering GUI elements which were solved by the second video. Never move your GUI, kids.

	<a href="https://youtu.be/CKX7-R7au30"><b>LAAT (Physics, LOD)</b></a>
	<br>
	This is the simulator I've always wanted. Essentially, the player pilots an LAAT/i troop transport from Star Wars during the Battle of Geonosis,
	dropping troops and providing fire support at key locations to turn the tide of the battle. I learned a lot about flight physics here, because my primary
	goal was to perfectly emulate what I saw on the screen, but in gameplay. I based the physics off of a hypothetical helicopter whose rotor could pitch and roll a
	generous amount away from the vertical axis, providing more forward than vertical thrust the more pitched down/up you were. The resulting system was actually
	incredibly intuitive and easy to fly (At least by my standards). I also learned a bit about the LOD system. Since I was using a huge map and wanted a fairly dense
	world, I realised early on that I'd need to make use of Unity's LOD system to prevent massive slowdowns, and was mostly successful. I planned to populate the
	battlefield with ground troops and units dynamically, popping them in depending on your distance from the ground and your location on the map. Unfortunately, I
	realised the game would've been better suited as a more tightly-focused set of missions rather than a single, open-ended mission, and soon moved on. I have plans
	for essentially that using my own IP, but it's not something I'm currently seriously working on. If you're wondering, you're a VTOL craft shot from a carrier
	ship in orbit directly into enemy airspace. It'll be dope.

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj5ptFLqr8A"><b>Various VR Tests (Animation, Stereoscopy)</b></a><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XA9W7O0-1E"><b>(Second Video)</b></a>
	<br>
	These occurred shortly after I received my Oculus Rift DK1.<br>
	The first video occurred after experimenting with 2D animation and states with a 2D game for a game jam on a small website. This would've been
	some kind of game about captaining a starship as it went about the galaxy, but I never got very far with it. I like the 2.5D presentation the most.<br>
	The second video was an attempt to have control over the actions of a held weapon in a first person game without motion controllers involved, as
	they had not yet been released (Or invented) at the time. Essentially, the weapon would switch between a lowered, aimed, and reloading position
	based on the angle of the player's head. By leaning right, as if aiming down the sights, the weapon would move into position, allowing the player
	to actually aim down the sights. By looking another direction, the player could look down the magazine and see if they were out of ammo. By
	holding their gaze in that direction, the magazine would automatically drop and a new one would be loaded.<br>
	Pretty much every game I work on has some kind of plans for VR support, but due to Oculus retroactively breaking DK1 support, my later experiments never
	show this.
