	Virtually all of my time is spent making or playing games.
	<br><br>
	I started making games in Game Maker around 2003, when I was 9. Over the years I moved from it's drag & drop-styled
	visual programming, to GML, to a brief stint with Blitz BASIC for a Grade 11 course, to Unity in 2013, which I use
	to this day. I program primarily in C#.
	<br><br>
	I am very interested in VR, and own an original Oculus Rift dev kit (Which no longer works for developing). I released a
	small demo allowing the player to walk around the bridge of a Star Destroyer as it enters battle. I've
	also created a number of other, unreleased demos that made me learn the meaning of "Sim sickness." There are a few
	that I'd still like to continue development on if I can ever afford the proper hardware.
	<br><br>
	I've made countless experiments* in my time, and I've even finished a couple of projects here and there, such as a
	TIE Fighter arcade game, released under a psuedonym because it is definitely not a huge copyright infringement
	that could incur the wrath of certain companies. Tell all your friends!
	<br><br>
	Below are some links to videos of my various projects from recent years.
