	Virtually all of my time is spent making or playing games. It's really quite sad.
	<br><br>
	I started using Game Maker's Drag & Drop programming interface around 2003, when I was 9.
	At some point around 2007 - 2008, I began learning GML, Game Maker's dedicated programming language.
	I started using Unity in 2013, learning C# and Javascript.
	<br><br>
	I am very interested in VR, and own an original Oculus Rift dev kit (Which no longer works for developing). I created a
	small demo allowing the player to walk around the bridge of a Star Destroyer as it enters a battle. I've
	created a number of other, unreleased, demos that made me learn the meaning of "Sim sickness." There are a few
	that I'd still like to continue development on if I can ever afford proper hardware.
	<br><br>
	I've made countless experiments* in my time, and I've even finished a couple of projects here and there.
	You can find some examples in the links below.
